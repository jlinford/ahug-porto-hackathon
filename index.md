Arm’s Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) has arrived, but what does SVE mean for typical high performance computing (HPC) workloads and how do you use it? This non-NDA event targets students and researchers developing HPC applications for emerging architectures.  We will present the fundamentals of vector length agnostic programming, introduce software tools for working with SVE, and show how common HPC codes can be recompiled to take advantage of large vector lengths without code modifications.  Remote access to Arm hardware will be provided.  


# Schedule

## 9:00am – Introduction and Fundamentals

Short presentations from community members, SVE tool developers, application teams, and hardware developers to introduce core concepts and lay the roadmap for future SVE applications.

## 12:00pm – Hands-on with SVE

The entirely hands-on afternoon session will introduce the Arm's tools for SVE developers and show how to generate SVE-enabled binaries targeting popular vector lengths. The session will include contributions from people who are running and porting applications for SVE.
