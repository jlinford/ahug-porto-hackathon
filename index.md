Arm’s Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) has arrived, but what does SVE mean for typical high performance computing (HPC) workloads and how do you use it? This non-NDA event targets students and researchers developing HPC applications for emerging architectures.  We will present the fundamentals of vector length agnostic programming, introduce software tools for working with SVE, and show how common HPC codes can be recompiled to take advantage of large vector lengths without code modifications.  Remote access to Arm hardware will be provided.  

# Update - Event Cancelled

Unfortunately, due to the current situation with COVID-19, a decision has been made to postpone the A-HUG event in Porto this month. 

Travel restrictions for presenters and attendees has made hosting the hackathon untenable at this time. We are very sorry for the short notice of this cancellation, however the safety of attendees and presenters is our number one priority.

Details will be communicated about the date of rescheduled event, when they are known. For those of you attending ISC’20 this year, we plan on hosting a similar SVE hackathon event there and invite you to attend. 

If you have any additional questions about the hackathon please do not hesitate to contact us at the email addresses below.

Stay safe,
Olly Perks, John Linford, Conrad Hillairet and Luiz DeRose

## 12:00pm – Hands-on with SVE

The entirely hands-on afternoon session will introduce the Arm's tools for SVE developers and show how to generate SVE-enabled binaries targeting popular vector lengths. The session will include contributions from people who are running and porting applications for SVE. For this session we will be using an Arm based AWS Elastic Cluster, this will come pre-installed with all the required Arm HPC software stack for building code and emulating SVE. Accounts will be provided for all attendees.
